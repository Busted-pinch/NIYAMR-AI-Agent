  "summary_text": "1. **PURPOSE**: The act aims to amend Universal Credit (UC) regulations to adjust the standard allowance and specific elements like the Limited Capability for Work and Work-Related Activity (LCWRA) element for the tax years 2026-27 to 2029-30, ensuring that financial support aligns with inflation.\n\n2. **KEY DEFINITIONS**: Key terms defined include “standard allowance,” which is the baseline financial support under UC, \"protected LCWRA amount,\" and \"relevant CPI percentage,\" which refers to the inflation measure used for annual adjustments. Definitions for \"pre-2026 claimant\" and \"severe conditions criteria claimant\" determine eligibility under specific circumstances.\n\n3. **ELIGIBILITY**: Individuals eligible for UC must meet defined criteria concerning their financial status and capabilities, particularly those categorized under the LCWRA element due to severe conditions. Eligibility also applies to individuals who are terminally ill or have sustained continuous claims due to qualifying conditions established prior to 2026.\n\n4. **OBLIGATIONS**: Claimants are required to maintain compliance by reporting changes in circumstances, providing accurate information regarding their conditions, and adhering to assessment requirements for ongoing eligibility. The Department for Communities must ensure that the amounts for benefits reflect inflationary adjustments on an annual basis.\n\n5. **ENFORCEMENT**: The Act outlines enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance with both the obligations set forth in the UC system and the calculations for benefit adjustments as mandated by the act. Non-compliance may result in penalties, and enforcement authorities are empowered to monitor adherence to legislative requirements and investigate potential fraud."
